Description: Functions for analyzing check-all-that-apply (CATA) data from consumer and sensory tests. Cochran's Q test, McNemar's test, and Penalty-Lift analysis provided, as described in for CATA data analysis by Meyners, Castura & Carr (2013) <doi:10.1016/j.foodqual.2013.06.010>. Cluster analysis can be performed using b-cluster analysis. The quality of cluster analysis solutions can be evaluated using various measures. The methods related to b-cluster analysis are described in a pre-print manuscript by Castura, Meyners, Varela & Naes (2021) <https://secure.compusense.com/research/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Castura_bcluster_submitted_20211130.pdf>.

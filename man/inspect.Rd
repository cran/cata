\title{Inspect/summarize many b-cluster analysis runs}
\usage{
inspect(X, G = 2, bestB = NULL, bestM = NULL, inspect.plot = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{list of multiple runs of b-cluster analysis results from 
\code{\link[cata]{bcluster.n}} or \code{\link[cata]{bcluster.h}}}

\item{G}{number of clusters (required for non-hierarchical algorithm)}

\item{bestB}{total sensory differentiation retained in the best solution. If
not provided, then \code{bestB} is determined from best solution in the runs
provided (in \code{X}).}

\item{bestM}{cluster memberships for best solution. If not provided, then 
the best solution is determined from the runs provided (in \code{X}).}

\item{inspect.plot}{default (\code{TRUE}) plots results from the 
\code{\link[cata]{inspect}} function}
}
\value{
A data frame with unique solutions in rows and the following
columns:
\itemize{
\item{\code{B} : Sensory differentiation retained}
\item{\code{PctB} : Percentage of the total sensory differentiation retained}
\item{\code{B.prop} : Proportion of sensory differentiation retained compared
to best solution}
\item{\code{Raw.agree} : raw agreement with best solution}
\item{\code{Count} : number of runs for which this solution was observed} 
\item{\code{Index} : list index (i.e., run number) of first solution  
solution in \code{X} corresponding to this row}}
}
\description{
Inspect many runs of b-cluster analysis. Calculate sensory differentiation 
retained and recurrence rate.
}
\examples{
data(bread)

res <- bcluster.n(bread$cata[1:8, , 1:5], G = 3, runs = 3)
(ires <- inspect(res))
# get index of solution retaining the most sensory differentiation (in these runs)
indx <- ires$Index[1]
# cluster memberships for solution of this solution
res[[indx]]$cluster
